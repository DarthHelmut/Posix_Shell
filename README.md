# SLSHELL



This is a very basic shell mostly Posix compliant still working on that part
Working on allowing customs prompts


Install
add /usr/bin/SLSHELL to /etc/shells
sudo chsh -s /usr/bin/SLSHELL "user"
logout out and log back in
let me know how the shell works or issues and I will get around to fixing it
